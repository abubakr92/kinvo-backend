    floor for every request the mobile app ever makes, and changing it later
    means rebuilding the whole stack and migrating the database.

    x86, not ARM, and that is deliberate.

    Graviton is about 20% cheaper, but postgis/postgis publishes no arm64
    image and the container dies with an exec format error. Chasing a
    community arm64 PostGIS build would mean staging and production running
    a different database image from local development, which is the kind of
    difference that hides bugs until they reach users. Roughly $3/month
    buys that problem away.

    t3.small is 2 vCPU / 2 GB, enough for the API, Postgres and Redis
    together. t3.micro (1 GB) cannot hold Node plus Postgres.
