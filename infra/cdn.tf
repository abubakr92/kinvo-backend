# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CloudFront — HTTPS without owning a domain
#
# iOS App Transport Security refuses plain http://, and no certificate authority
# will issue a certificate for a bare IP address. CloudFront hands you
# https://xxxx.cloudfront.net on an AWS certificate, which is enough for the
# mobile app and TestFlight while a domain is being sorted out.
#
# The honest caveat: TLS terminates at CloudFront and the hop to the instance is
# HTTP. Acceptable for staging with test data; not acceptable for production
# with real users. Set var.domain_name and Caddy takes over TLS end to end,
# at which point this distribution can be pointed at the domain or removed.
