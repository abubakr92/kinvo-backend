# CLAUDE.md — Kinvo Backend

Working notes for anyone (human or agent) touching this repository.
The authoritative product specification is `KINVO_BACKEND_BUILD.md`. **Read it before changing behaviour.** This file is the operational summary, not a replacement.

---

## What this is

REST API for **Kinvo**, a multi-mode social connection app. Clients: a Flutter mobile app, and a future admin web client. **APIs only** — no web frontend, no server-rendered views.

---

## The core architectural rule: mode scoping

Kinvo is not one social graph with a mode tag bolted on. It is **eight parallel graphs** sharing one user table, one media store, one billing account, and one moderation pipeline.

The eight modes: `dating`, `study_buddy`, `networking`, `trading`, `foodie`, `cuddle`, `pet_dates`, `fitness`.

- Swipes are unique on `(actor_id, target_id, mode)`. The same pair may like in one mode and pass in another.
- A match belongs to **exactly one** mode. Two users can hold several simultaneous matches in different modes.
- A conversation inherits its match's mode and never changes it.
- Discovery preferences are stored **per mode** (`UserMode`), not once per user.
- Decks are built per `(user, mode, day)`.
- Deck actions are always `pass` | `like` | `super_like`. Mode changes only the **label the app renders** — served from `GET /config`. Never create per-mode action enums.

**Trading is an interest category and nothing else.** No endpoint moves money or assets between users, records a trade, or serves market data. Its one asymmetry: scam/payment-language moderation checks must be globally scoped, not dating-scoped, because this mode attracts investment fraud.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env

npm run db:up          # docker compose up -d  (postgres + redis + minio)
npm run db:deploy      # apply committed migrations
npm run db:seed        # idempotent development data
npm run db:reset       # drop, re-migrate, re-seed
npm run dev            # tsx watch, hot reload
npm run build          # tsc -> dist, path aliases rewritten by tsc-alias
npm start              # run the build

npm test               # jest
npm run test:coverage  # with the 80% threshold enforced
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint           # eslint (flat config)
npm run format         # prettier --write
```

Docker exposes Postgres on **5433** and Redis on **6380** so they never collide with local installs.

Path aliases: `@/*`, `@config/*`, `@middleware/*`, `@modules/*`, `@utils/*`. Declared in `tsconfig.json` and mirrored in `jest.config.js` — **change both together.**

---

## Non-negotiable conventions

**Layering.** Routes call controllers, controllers call services, services own business logic and touch the database. No business logic in a route handler. No database access from a controller.

**Validation.** Every endpoint validates with Zod via the `validate` middleware before business logic runs.

**Envelope (spec 4.2).** Every response goes through `src/utils/response.ts`. Never `res.json()` directly.

```jsonc
{ "success": true,  "data": {}, "meta": null }
{ "success": true,  "data": [], "meta": { "pagination": { "next_cursor": "…", "has_more": true, "limit": 20 } } }
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED", "message": "…", "details": null } }
```

`data` is always an object or array — wrap scalars as `{ "count": 4 }`. `message` is user-displayable. `code` is a stable machine contract; **renaming a shipped code is a breaking change.**

**Error codes.** Only from `src/utils/error-codes.ts`. Throw `ApiError`; never hand-roll an error response.

**Data formats (spec 4.6).**

- Timestamps: UTC ISO-8601 with `Z`, field names end in `_at`.
- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD` (date of birth only — store DOB, never an age integer).
- IDs: UUID v4 strings. Never sequential integers.
- JSON fields: `snake_case`.
- Enums: lowercase snake_case strings, never integers.
- Money: integer minor units plus currency.
- **Distance: metres.** The client formats to miles.
- Null vs absent: return `null`, never omit the key. Empty lists are `[]`.

**Pagination.** Cursor-based (opaque base64) for decks, matches, messages, notifications. Messages paginate backwards. Offset pagination is acceptable on admin lists only.

**Auth.** Bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header, returned in the response body — not cookies. Access 30 min, refresh 60 days, rotated on every use. A replayed refresh token revokes the whole family. Keep `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`, and `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` distinct — the app does something different for each.

Mount `authenticate` on anything needing a user, then `requireOnboarded` on **every** discovery, matching, and chat route. That second gate is what keeps accounts created by social or phone sign-in — which have no date of birth yet — out of the product until onboarding runs the under-18 check. Omitting it is a legal problem, not a UX one.

`date_of_birth` is nullable because Google, Apple, and Twilio do not supply one. Call `assertAdult()` from `@utils/age` **wherever** a date of birth is set, never only at registration.

Never widen `req.user` from a token claim. `authenticate` loads the user on every request so suspension and deletion take effect immediately rather than whenever the 30-minute token happens to expire.

**Secrets in tests.** Rate limits are off by default under test and switched on by the suite that asserts them. External HTTP — Twilio, Google, Apple — is mocked at the provider boundary in `src/providers/`; nothing below that line is faked.

**Quota vs rate limit.** Infrastructure protection → `429 RATE_LIMITED`. Business limits that sell subscriptions → `422 QUOTA_EXCEEDED` with paywall context. Conflating them hides the paywall and costs revenue.

**Entitlements (spec §5.11).** The tier→flag matrix is **data**. Nothing branches on a tier name — not in this module, not anywhere downstream. Moving a feature between tiers is a seed edit and a re-seed.

- Flag keys live in `entitlements.types.ts` and are imported by both the seed and the resolver, so a typo is a compile error rather than a flag that is silently always off.
- `resolve(userId)` returns every flag in one call. Callers needing several flags resolve once — the same N+1 rule as compact objects.
- A missing or wrongly typed row **fails closed**. A broken seed must never hand out a paid feature.
- The **matrix** is cached 60s in process. The **user's tier is never cached** — it changes the moment a payment clears, and a stale tier tells a paying customer to upgrade.
- `requireEntitlement(flag)` middleware gates **boolean** features only. Numeric caps are consumed inside the service transaction that performs the action, so `refundQuota` can give the allowance back when that action fails. Never charge a user for a swipe the database rejected.
- Quota counters are keyed `quota:{name}:{user}:{utc-day}` and expire at the next **UTC** midnight. Check-and-consume is one Lua script; GET-then-INCR lets concurrent requests burst past the cap.
- Quotas **fail open** when Redis is down. They bind only the free tier, so failing closed would trade a total outage for revenue nobody is paying.

**Redis in tests.** The client uses `lazyConnect` with the offline queue **disabled** under test, so a command issued before an explicit `connectRedis()` fails instead of buffering. Any suite touching quota counters must call it in `beforeAll` and `disconnectRedis()` in `afterAll`. Skipping it does not fail loudly — `readCount` swallows connection errors and reports zero used, which looks exactly like a fresh counter, so the suite passes while proving nothing. Never wrap a live Redis call in `jest.useFakeTimers()`: ioredis drives its command queue on real timers and the call never resolves.

**Subscriptions (spec §5.10).** Never grant entitlement from a client claim.

- Checkout accepts a product **slug** and nothing else — no tier, no price, no receipt. The schema is `.strict()`, so a client sending `tier: advanced` gets a 400 rather than being quietly ignored.
- Access changes in exactly one function, `applyProviderEvent`, reachable only from a signature-verified webhook. If a second path to granting access appears, that is the bug.
- The webhook route is **excluded from `express.json()`** in `app.ts`. Stripe signs the raw bytes; parsing and re-serialising changes them, and every signature fails in a way that reads like a wrong webhook secret.
- Processing is idempotent by provider event id (`ProcessedWebhookEvent`). Providers retry; duplicates are routine, and the unique constraint is what makes a concurrent duplicate a no-op instead of a double-apply.
- `cancelled`, `in_grace_period` and `on_billing_retry` **keep** access — the period is paid for, and a card that needs reissuing must not cost the customer both the money and the feature. Refunds and disputes revoke **immediately**.
- Access ends on `current_period_end`, checked at read time. The nightly sweep is bookkeeping, so a late or failed sweep can never hand out free premium.
- Entitlement resolves from **Subscription rows**, never `user.subscription_tier` — that column is a denormalised copy for admin lists. A column somebody can edit is not an entitlement.

**Money.** Integer minor units plus a currency code. Never a float, never a formatted string.
**Blocks (spec 5.5).** Blocks beat everything. The shared exclusion clause lives in `src/modules/safety/block.service.ts` and **must never be re-implemented**:

- `visibleUserFilter(viewerId, blockedIds)` — compose into the `where` of any query that can surface another user. It already excludes blocked-either-direction, self, suspended, soft-deleted, and snoozed.
- `assertVisible(viewerId, targetId)` — call before returning anything about a specific user. Throws `404`.

Return `404`, not `403`, when a block is the reason; a 403 confirms the resource exists. "Blocked", "suspended", "deleted", and "never existed" must be byte-identical from outside.

**Compact objects (spec 4.7).** `user_compact` is built only by `toUserCompact()` in `src/utils/compact.ts`. It becomes one Dart model, so every list that returns a user returns exactly that shape.

**Discovery (spec §5.3).** The deck is where six rules must hold at once — blocks, mode, radius, age, already-swiped, account state. Any one failing surfaces someone who should never have been shown.

- Decks are persisted per `(user, mode, day)`. Re-running a ranking algorithm per scroll lets a card move between pages and be seen twice or never.
- `getDeck` generates lazily when today’s deck is missing. The BullMQ precompute is an **optimisation, never a dependency** — a worker that is down must cost latency, not an empty product.
- **Ranking is not filtering.** Verification and boost move someone up a deck they already qualified for. Neither may place someone into a deck a filter excluded them from — that is how a paid boost would beat a block.
- The radius query cannot compose `visibleUserFilter`, so it takes an exclusion array and the shared clause runs on its result in Prisma. `CANDIDATE_POOL` stays far above `DECK_SIZE` so the split cannot truncate a correct answer.
- Already-swiped is scoped **per mode**. A pass in `dating` must not remove someone from the `study_buddy` deck.
- A pass costs no quota; only likes and super likes do. One constant in `swipe.service.ts`.

**Chat (spec §5.4).** A conversation belongs to exactly one match, inherits its mode, and has exactly two participants (decision #11). It is created inside the match transaction — there is no endpoint that makes one, because users cannot message before matching (decision #5).

- **Messages paginate backwards.** Newest first, cursor walking into history. Every other list in this API goes the other way.
- A conversation is closed when the pair is blocked, the match expired or was unmatched, or the other account left. **Every reason answers one identical 403** — distinguishing them lets a block be confirmed by elimination.
- `is_writable` is returned on matches and conversations so the app hides the composer rather than learning the state from a rejected send.
- **Match expiry is decided at read time** by `isExpired`, never by trusting the status column. The sweeper job only updates the column for admin lists; it being late must change nothing a user sees.
- Only the recipient’s `unread_count` moves on send. A new message un-archives the thread for them.
- Media messages go through `claimAsset` like everything else, so a verification document can never become a chat attachment.

**Cursors.** Opaque base64, built and read only by `src/utils/cursor.ts`. Anything that parses a cursor elsewhere has turned it into an API surface, and the ordering key can never change again without a client release. Fetch `limit + 1` rows and let `paginate()` derive `has_more` — a COUNT over a large filtered set costs more than the page.

**Realtime (spec §7).** Socket.IO is a **delivery layer, never a second write path**. Persist first, then emit — every emitter is called after its transaction commits, never inside one, or a rollback would announce a message that does not exist.

- **Register socket handlers before any `await` in the connection handler.** Socket.IO drops packets that have no listener yet, so every await is a window where a client emitting on connect loses the event silently.
- The disconnect handler **waits for the connect sequence** before undoing it. A socket that opens and closes in milliseconds otherwise leaves a phantom online entry.
- Presence counts **connections, not users** — a boolean marks someone offline when one of two devices closes. Redis, 90s TTL so network switches do not flicker.
- Presence is sent **only to active matches, never across a block**. Anything wider is an activity feed on someone who never agreed to share one.
- Online state is Redis; `last_active_at` is Postgres on a throttle. Never write presence to a durable store.
- `is_online` is resolved in bulk via `onlineStatusFor` and passed into `toUserCompact`, like the photo URL. Per-row presence is the same N+1 compact objects exist to prevent.
- Socket payloads are as untrusted as request bodies: validated by the same Zod schemas that generate `/docs/realtime.json`, so the docs cannot describe a payload the server rejects.
- The handshake reuses `verifyAccessToken`'s error mapping. Do not re-catch `TokenExpiredError` — it has already been converted, and a duplicate mapping turns every expiry into a sign-out.

**Jobs.** BullMQ needs its own Redis connection with `maxRetriesPerRequest: null`; its blocking commands would otherwise stall every rate-limit and quota command behind a worker poll. Nothing starts on import — tests load the Express app and must not open queues. A scheduler that fans out on the queue it feeds must branch on **job name**, or the repeatable job arrives with empty data and the worker processes it as real work.

**Onboarding.** The requirement list is a declared checklist in `src/modules/users/onboarding.service.ts`. Adding a requirement is one entry there — never a new condition scattered into the transition. Batch 4 adds "≥1 approved photo", Batch 5 adds "≥1 enabled mode".

**Moderation (spec §5.4).** Rules-based v1 behind `ModerationProvider` (decision #8). Two rules govern the whole module:

- **Advisory, never blocking.** `can_send` is a constant `true`. If it ever becomes conditional, the product has started blocking messages on a regex.
- **Fail open.** A provider timeout returns severity `none` with `timed_out: true` and queues the content. This applies to the send path too, not just the check endpoint — never cost a user their message because a third party was down.

Also:

- Checked content is **hashed, never stored**. A copy of every message someone considered sending is a surveillance database.
- Scam and payment rules **take no mode argument**, so they cannot be dating-scoped by accident (spec §1 — Trading attracts investment fraud).
- A provider that cannot assess a subject type **queues it for a human** rather than marking it clean. A healthy-looking queue that checks nothing is worse than no queue.
- Flags are idempotent per subject and severity **ratchets upward only** — a later benign scan must not quiet an earlier serious finding.
- False-positive tests matter as much as true-positive ones. A warning users dismiss reflexively protects nobody.

**Reporter anonymity (spec 5.7).** A reported user must never learn who reported them through any endpoint, notification, or error message.

**Notifications (spec §7).** **Every notification is persisted to the feed AND pushed — never pushed alone.** The Notifications screen reads the feed, so a push-only notification vanishes when the banner is dismissed. Persisting first is what makes push, email, and socket delivery all best-effort.

- A **missing preference row means the default**, not "off". Absent-as-off would silently disable notifications for every existing account.
- **Safety notifications cannot be muted** for push or in-app (§5.7). Email can be.
- The "someone liked you" notification **never names who** — that is behind a paywall, and a banner would give it away.
- `total` in badge counts **excludes `discover`**: cards waiting is not a thing the user is behind on, and a permanently non-zero badge trains people to ignore it.
- FCM tokens belong to a **device**, not a user. Re-registering a token moves it off its previous device, because FCM issues one per install.
- Clear a token only on FCM's **permanent-failure** codes. A network blip is not a dead device.
- Scheduled work is a **sweep**, not a timer per row — sweeps survive restarts and edits, and the feed doubles as the idempotency key.

**Logging.** Pino only — `no-console` is an ESLint error. No PII in logs; redaction lives in `src/utils/logger.ts`. Log `req.path`, never `req.originalUrl`.

**Database.** Import the client from `@/db/prisma` — never from `src/generated/prisma`, which is Prisma 7's git-ignored output directory. Prisma 7 connects through `@prisma/adapter-pg`, not a URL on the client.

**PostGIS.** Prisma cannot read or write a `geography` column; those fields are `Unsupported()` in the schema. Every spatial query lives in `src/db/geo.ts` and nowhere else. Coordinate order is `(longitude, latitude)` — `ST_MakePoint` takes X then Y. Distances are always metres.

**Migrations.** GIST indexes, CHECK constraints, and partial unique indexes cannot be expressed in `schema.prisma` and are hand-written at the bottom of the migration SQL. **If you regenerate a migration, re-apply them.**

**Media.** Uploads are a two-step handshake: the API issues a presigned PUT, the client uploads straight to storage, then the API HEADs the object to record what actually landed. An asset with no `uploaded_at` is an intent, not an asset, and may never be attached to anything — the client saying "done" is a claim, not evidence.

Both buckets are private, so every media URL is presigned and time-limited, minted on read. `S3_MEDIA_BUCKET` holds photos, chat media, and voice notes; `S3_VERIFICATION_BUCKET` holds government ID images and report evidence, with a much shorter URL lifetime. **Never merge them.** Locally both live in MinIO (docker-compose), which speaks the S3 API — the SDK and the presigning are real, only the endpoint differs from AWS.

`claimAsset()` is how anything attaches media. It checks ownership, completion, and kind together, so a verification document can never be promoted into the public photo table.

**Secrets.** Environment only, validated at boot. Never in code.

**Comments.** Explain _why_, not _what_. Business rules from the spec cite their section number.

## How work is sequenced

15 batches, defined in `KINVO_BACKEND_BUILD.md` §7. Rules:

1. One batch at a time, in order.
2. State the goal and the file list, then wait for confirmation before writing code.
3. Finish the batch — code, tests, docs.
4. Full test suite green.
5. Print the §0.6 completion report.
6. **Stop.** Do not start the next batch unbidden.

When blocked, ask. Do not invent a business rule and bury it in code.

**Tests are not optional.** Integration tests per endpoint covering happy path, validation failure, auth failure, and the permission boundary (can user A touch user B's resource?). Unit tests for pure logic. Real Postgres, mocks only for external HTTP. 80% line coverage on `src/` excluding config. Tests seed and clean their own data and run in any order.

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS. S3 for media bytes only — never application records.                                                                  |
| 4   | **Trading mode:** interest category only, no trading functionality.                                                                                       |
| 13  | **Payment rails: Stripe only.** Apple IAP and Google Play Billing are out of scope — both stores belong to the mobile team. The `PaymentProvider` interface exists anyway, so adding a store later is a new class and nothing else. |
| 2,3 | **Four SKUs:** Basic and Premium × monthly and yearly. Annual is a third off. No quarterly (sells to nobody), no weekly (a churn machine), no free trial in v1. Tier matrix unchanged from the Batch 6 provisional. |
| 5   | **"Requests" tab:** a **likes-you inbox** — profiles, not messages. Users cannot message before matching, so a conversation always has a match behind it. |
| 11  | **Study Buddy groups:** one-to-one only in v1. Every conversation has exactly two participants.                                                           |

| —   | Cloudflare R2 instead of S3 for media   | —      | Not blocking. Same SDK, different endpoint; the argument is egress cost at real traffic. |

**Shipped on engineering placeholders, not PO decisions** (DECISIONS.md §1.2e).
The PO can still overrule any of these; the table records what each costs to change.

| 7   | Free tier: 50 swipes/day per mode, 30 messages/day. Seed edit. |
| 10  | Rewind is premium (basic and above). Seed edit. |
| 6   | Match expiry 14 days; the conversation goes read-only and stays visible. TTL is a constant; the conversation behaviour is **code**. |
| 8   | Moderation is rules-based v1 behind a provider interface. Provider swap. |
| —   | A blocked pair's conversation is frozen and visible; every other path 404s. **Code.** |
| —   | Profile photo URLs are presigned S3 GETs, not CDN signed URLs — so Flutter's image cache misses on every render. |

## Trap checklist — run at the end of every batch

1. Does every new query filter by **mode** where it should?
2. Does every new endpoint use the shared **block** exclusion clause?
3. Timestamps UTC, ISO-8601, `Z`, `_at` suffix?
4. Distances in **metres**?
5. Enums as strings, not integers?
6. Do list endpoints return compact objects, or force **N+1** follow-up calls?
7. Quota returns **422 with paywall context**, not 429?
8. **404 instead of 403** where a block is the reason?
9. Can a reported user learn who reported them through any path?
10. Envelope on **everything** — errors and empty lists included?
